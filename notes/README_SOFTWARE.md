## :star: About this Guide
<h5> THIS GUIDE IS A DETAILED OVERVIEW OF OUR PROJECT'S SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION AND DEPLOYMENT </h5>

## :computer: Software Components

### :one: Microcontroller Code 
<h5> <b>MSP430-FR2433 Chip Code</b> </h5>

#### :gear: Compilation
 
Compilation of the original source code (<code>EC463/src/VETCON/src/main.cpp</code>) is done through PlatformIO, a platform that interacts with the Wiring Framework to allow developers to use the Arduino format standard for any number of microcontrollers. 

Following the execution of a PlatformIO Build, a <code>firmware.elf</code> file is generated in the <code>.pio/$(PLATFORM_NAME)/ </code> folder of the project directory, which contains all of the linked firmware to be flashed to the board. 

This <code>firmware.elf</code> file is to be distributed to end users of the board, attending DEFCON, as a way to reflash their board in the situation where the board memory becomes corrupted. To reflash the board with the <code>firmware.elf</code>, one can use UniFlash, locate the board as a serial interface and then place in the location of the <code>firmware.elf</code> file, wherever the user has determined to store it.


#### :gear: Function

The MCU (Micro Controller Unit) code controls all of the on-board hardware, including the LEDs, buttons, LCD Screen, and the Bluetooth module (discussed in the following section in detail), as well as provides the user interaction methods by way of serial communication channels. 

The board can be interfaced with by way of buttons, but not in any useful way without a serial channel being opened up between a host and the board. Be sure to use a serial communication program that has implicit line endings, as otherwise formatting will be off. 

Once a user does plug in the board and open up a serial connection, they will need to be sure to kill the UniFlash process, as it takes up the board communication channel, and  do a soft reset of the board to make sure it sends out the "WELCOME TO VETCON" message (only on the first run), as well as the main menu. The main menu contains all of the options for user interaction: 

- <code>1. Set Name Tag</code>
- <code>2. Display Name Tag</code>
- <code>3. Game Link</code>
- <code>4. Game Link 2</code>
- <code>8. Start Bluetooth</code>
- <code>0. Reset Badge</code>

The list of possible inputs can expand over time, though, with the final menu being displayed as:

- <code>1. Set Name Tag</code>
- <code>2. Display Name Tag</code>
- <code>3. Game Link</code>
- <code>4. Game Link 2</code>
- <code>5. Secret Token</code>
- <code>6. Secret Token 2</code>
- <code>7. Secret Token 3</code>
- <code>8. Start Bluetooth</code>
- <code>9. LED CNTRL Menu</code>
- <code>0. Reset Badge</code>

These new options are revealed to the user through input of the secret codes, acquired through completion of the online games (discussed later in full). 

These codes are obfuscated when presented to the user, but here they are  translated, the exact encryption and decryption method for each code will be discussed in their corresponding game. The plaintext secret codes are as follows:

- <code>Game 1: "1016"</code> 
  - <code>Unlocks: "6. Secret Token 2"</code> 
- <code>Game 2: "semperdisco"</code> 
  - <code>Unlocks: "7. Secret Token 3"</code> 
- <code>Game 3: "ilovevetcon"</code>

The process to begin inputting these secret codes is for the user to input: <code>9</code> to the initial menu. 

As the user inputs these secret codes into the device, external LEDs are lit in accordance with each unlocked secret, these are more aptly described in <code>README_HARDWARE.md</code>. 

Once all of the secrets have been unlocked, option <code>9. LED CNTRL Menu</code> is unlocked, allowing the user to choose the LED states to save power if they decide that is necessary. 

To control the LEDs, the user enters option <code>9. LED CNTRL Menu</code>, where they will be taken to the LED control menu, where they are presented with the following input options:

-   <code>1: Turn LEDs OFF</code>
    -   This places the MSP in a hibernate low-power state, which can be exited by toggling the "reset" button on the board itself
-   <code>2: LED 'WAVE'</code>
-   <code>3: LED 'BLINK'</code>
-   <code>4: LED 'ALTERNATE'</code>
-   <code>5: Back 2 Main Menu</code>

#### :radio: Bluetooth

Bluetooth functionality is relatively simple. By selecting option 8 from the main menu the user will enter the bluetooth() function. This will prompt them with the option to type 1 for communication, or type 2 to setup the parent and child connection. NOTE[The EN switch pin needs to be on for option 2, the parent/child connection to function properly. Similarliy, while it is on, option 1 for regular communication will not function properly: Please see hardware explanation for more info]
    
If two badges have already been paried, then selecting option 1 will allow the user to type data in serial [up to 15 characters]. This will then send the data to the paired badge which they can see on their menu "Data Received: "and respond back with their own message. 
    
How to pair badges: Your badge will come with your HC-05's hex address. While the EN pin is switched selecting option 2 from the menu will prompt the user to type certain commands into serial. These commands will be sent to the HC-05 through software serial which is currently in AT mode (a mode that allows for command acception). First the user can type either "AT+ROLE=0" for child or "AT+ROLE=1" for parent. If choosing child, the user is done. They can switch off the enable pin and wait for a connection. If choosing parent, the user will also have to type "AT+BIND=" and then include the hex address of the child badge they want to connect to. Once this step is complete, they can also switch off their EN pin and communicate through option 1 with the child. 
    
To exit the bluetooth menu and return, the user is always prompted to type "exitnowpls". Typing this command the software will kick them back to the main menu function.

### :three: Game 2
<h5> Coin Flip </h5>

The source for Game 2 can be found in:
- <a href="../minigames/coin_flip"> Minigames Folder </a>

Game 2 is fairly simple in construction and execution. At it's core, it is an .HTML file with some Vanilla-Javascript addons, which we will briefly describe in a moment.

The most important code snippets are the following, which are all explained in a high-level in [Interaction](#gear-interaction-1)

First, is the basic HTML syntax responsible for the "flip" animation
```
@keyframes spin-tails {
  0% {
  transform: rotateX(0);
  }

  100% {
  transform: rotateX(1980deg);
  }
}

@keyframes spin-heads {
  0% {
  transform: rotateX(0);
  }

  100% {
  transform: rotateX(2160deg);
  }
}
```
Next, are the 'set' and 'get' and 'delete' functions for cookies.

```
function getCookie(name) {
    return (name = (document.cookie + ';').match(new RegExp(name + '=.*;'))) && name[0].split(/=|;/)[1];
}

function setCookie(name, value, days) {
    if (getCookie(name)) {
        if (value = ! "") {
            return;
        }
    }
    else {
        var e = new Date;
        e.setDate(e.getDate() + (days || 365));
        document.cookie = name + "=" + value + ';expires=' + e.toUTCString() + ';path=/;domain=.' + document.domain + "; Secure";
    }
}

function deleteCookie(name) {
        setCookie(name, "", -1);
}
```

Finally, the event listener for the button presses

```
flipBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
          let i = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
          coin.style.animation = "none";
          if (i) {
              setTimeout(function () {
                  coin.style.animation = "spin-heads 3s forwards";
              }, 100);
              heads++;

              if (getRandomInt(1, 2) == 1) {
                  if (!getCookie("tails")) {

                      setCookie("heads", "4315323515421424431334", 30)
                  }
              }

          }
          else {
              setTimeout(function () {
                  coin.style.animation = "spin-tails 3s forwards";
              }, 100);
              tails++;

              if (getRandomInt(1, 2) == 2) {
                  if (!getCookie("heads")) {

                      setCookie("tails", "3411323115333443242344234424521532244442453454141544431152543131111542453454", 30)
                  }
              }

          }
          setTimeout(updateStats, 3000);
          disableButton();
});
```

#### :gear: Compilation
Because .HTML is, in essence, a *markup languge* and Javascript is a *scripting language* for web pages (written in markup languages), there is no compilation in the traditional sense (aka Java, C-family languages, Rust, Go, Swift, etc.)

A full explanation of how the HTML script is converted into bytes, the creation of the Document-Object-Model (DOM), and Javascript's interaction with the DOM, can be found here (kind of optional)
  - <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-scenes/"> Browser Rendering </a>

So, all in all, to "compile" our game, just have a modern browser on hand, and double click the .HTML file located in the folder. To view the source, open the file with a text editor/IDE of your choice.

#### :gear: Deployment
If you've read through the tutorial for Game 1's deployment, you should already understand how web-deployment of this app (specifically through Github Pages) works. <a href = "https://pages.github.com/"> Here's a quick Github Pages Reference </a> if you're unsure or have not seen it before. Other alternatives include hosting your webpage locally/on a fileserver using <a href = "https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> or <a href = "https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>

Briefly, deployment of Game 2 is as simple as the following steps:
- Create a new repository.
- Push the .HTML file to the repository, ensure it is the only file in the repository, and it is at the root of the repository.
- Enable the Github Pages Deployment feature.
- Visit your webpage at the URL provided by GH Pages

#### :gear: Interaction
The purpose of this game is to understand how to leverage cached website/web-app data (in the form of cookies) to your advantage.

Cookies are basically just strings of text that are cached locally on your browser. They

## :memo: Some Notes
If you'd like to continue this project, you might want to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) OR [duplicate](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) this repository rather than attempting to push your own commits/do a pull request. This way, you get to have as much creative freedom with the code as you desire (obviously respecting the GNU GPL v3 license).

We intend to keep this repo as-is in a "finished" state. 

If you do have any questions, or make any cool developments/improvements that you would like to let us know about! Feel free to shoot us an email with the header: [GH EC463] + your name - {subject}

Happy hunting :)
