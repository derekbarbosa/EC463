## September
Entries here will be reserved specifically for the remainder of September.

### 9/20/2021
* Project Teams are assigned.
* Assigned to Team 32 -- VETCON BADGE
* Reviewed and began to interact with team members

### 9/21/2021
* Regrouped with team. Took team photos, decided to hold off on hitting the ground running until the following day

### 9/22/2021
* Started a Slack Workspace to manage group communication
	- Integrated BU Google Workspace Calendar into Slack Integrations
	- Started a Trello Board to manage project details, integrated to Slack
	- Created a Team Calendar to keep track of "who is in class" and facilitate the arrangement of meeting times.
	- Got in contact with client to arrange meeting time. Tentative for 9/24/2021 3PM Eastern.
	- Assigned the task of formulating questions for the client for further information on desired specifications to team members who would not be present during the inital cient meeting.

### 9/23/2021
* Finalized meeting details with our client. Confirmed for 9/24/2021 3pm eastern.
* Began drafting questions based on project requirements. Instructed group members to do the same.
* Set up a GH repo for our documentation. Linked to Slack Channel using webhooks to keep version control hygiene.

### 9/24/2021
* Met with clients! 
* attached notes for client meeting
* Ryan said he would take care of the inital PDRR writeup, will pause work for the weekend.

### 9/27/2021
* Brainstorming approach to IC/embedded system approach as described by client
* during review of the product specifications, clients emphasized battery life and weight
	* asked us to be somewhat conservative with the tradeoff
* started to look at TI-83/84 PCBs, determining best practices to create a low-power system with programmable memory.
* attaching notes to this upload :)

### 9/28/2021
* talk about rabbit hole research about calculators and low-power electronics
* Did a little more research on calculators and their "mini" operating system
	* this is following up on the design requirements from the client. They desired something that was "hackable" and easily "dumpable." They didn't need a "full" OS as we know today (Raspbian, etc) but would be fine with basic operating systems/firmware controller software.
	* Why so much research into calculators -- they are low power "embedded systems" that run off of AA batteries (less than 1100 mAh) for months at a time, with built-in save state and sleep cycles. Programmable Memory + ROM combination with fast (near instant) boot times.
	* Specifically looking into implementing KnightOS, a FOSS calculator OS that can run on TI-83/84s.
	* TI-83/84/84plus/84CE run on Zilog Z80, same processor in the old Sinclair Computers and other older computing systems. Easy to breadboard and fairly understandable datasheet compared to more modern microprocessors. Fairly straightforward ASM implementation as well if any need to get "manual" with the code.

* Much harder than just plugging in a Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero-W and calling it a day. But you get massive flexibility tradeoff + battery life
	* RPI consumes 1A with a few plugins/accessories running, would need 120WH battery (bigger than FAA/FCC limit) to power the device for 24 hours
	* RPI allows for easy compatiability with COTS components and rpi-approved "hats" out of GPIO plugins
	* benefit of working with linux kernel directly + debian-based OS tools.

* Met with Team -- reviewed the zoom call notes and discussed the approaches above. 
* Assigned John Kircher as the Team Leader for the first rotation. He will be working on the PDRR. I will contribute to the slide deck.

## October
Entries here will be reserved specifically for the month of October.

### 10/1/2021

* Researched ISA/Microprocessor compatability with KnightOS and Espilon OS (open source "calculator" operating systems that can be forked and edited for specific functionality.

* Began to look into parts ordering, accounting for 50 dollar budget.

* Created a slides template for the PDRR review


### 10/3/2021
* Preparing for PDRR initial presentation 10/7
* Not many new updates -- quick tag-up with team about next steps and what "we want to do" with our lead time
* Reviewed Presentation slides and script, made some edits to specifications
* Began working on PDRR written report

### 10/5/2021
* Attempted to find an easier middle ground between high-power (but flexible) SBC (single-board-computer) such a rasberry PI and manually soldering together an MCU and ROM.
* Encountered complete "embedded" development kits, closer to an SOC (think Arduino Uno's ATMEGA MCU / ESP32) but with an emphasis on ultra-low power consumption without entirely sacrificing QoL IDE tools
	* Board(s) of question: Texas Instruments "LaunchPad" development kits for the ultra-low power MSP430 MCU family -- https://www.ti.com/design-resources/embedded-development/hardware-kits-boards.html#launchpad
* Why this approach? 
	* As mentioned in the bullet above, Power Consumption is something our team needs to account for at all time.
	* The MSP430 famiy consumes 1.3 ÂµA on average, and can still send enough power to "juice" a LFR display.
	* "mini" or "micro" MCU devkits allow us to have a consistent environment to prototype our code if we decide to just use an MSP430 and ROM soldered directly onto a board.
	* Enables flexibility with IDEs and built-in code snippets for code re-use
	* Can also leverage other family of MCUs, such as the ESP32 family.
	* Specifically, the FireBeetle https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1590.html -- has a low power consumption of 0.011 mA.
* Next steps?
	* Do some research of sample projects using these DevKits -- what are some issues that developers run into when debugging these boards
	* Look at some other DefCon badges that leveraged Arduino/arduino-like SOCs (especially their open-source git repos)
	* Review datasheets and peripheral compatability
	* Relay research back to Client -- inform them of approach
	* Compare SOC approach vs SBC vs Bare-Metal
	* Look into reverse-engineering SOC into bare-metal PCB
### 10/8/2021
* Regrouped with Team -- agreed to vote on specific approach next monday.
* Discussed at length the pros+cons of each architecture, we described our preferences and laid out our "greivances"
* Relayed that we might not hit power consumption requirements if we follow up with RPI approach.
* Decided as a team to "take off" until after Indigenous People's Day

### 10/12/2021
* Team has decided to go with DevKit approach. I will put orders in for MSP420s (low power) and Arduno Minis (that can leverage the low-power settings)
* Will also put in an order for a Digital Multimeter, maybe some breadboards too (so they can arrive in time).
* Started drafting some sketches describing how we would program the SOC memory using the built-in IDEs provided to us.
* John released the first draft of our PDRR -- Started to revise and edit some of the content for the final review prior to submission

### 10/15/2021
* Started to review datasheets for the MSP420/430 programming specifications
* installed the Eclipse-based IDE and verified debugging functionality (IDE specific to the TI LaunchPad board)
* Gathering materials and slide decks to present to our client again this saturday.
* Putting in orders for additional LEDs and Breadboards -- looking into drafting some starter designs to meet the creative aspect of the assignment.
* Began to look for example code to pull "inspiration" about starter code.

### 10/18/2021
* Discussed upcoming "plan of attack" with team. Realigned goals and applied pivots to tasks.
* Established a variety of roles for the project:
	- Software
	- Power Consumption 
	- Hardware/PCB design
	- Hacking Minigame
* The four roles align somewhat well with the 5 teammembers, as we have a good mix of skills. I volunteered myself for SW debugging
* Discussed how to set up our inital dev cycles upon arrival of our hardware (TIMSP430).
* Filled in the rest of team on how/why we should consider meeting up once or twice a week to do merges and progress meetings (to align with agile fashion)
* Presented MVP to VETCON Client, edited slides to reflect Shark Tank Presentation.

### 10/20/2021
* Hardware has officially arrived!
* Touched up the PDRR report
* revised our slides for Shark Tank
* Received excellent manufacturing advice from transitioning from SOC --> Custom PCB with MCUs, got the contact info of a manufacturer
* Received advice to leverage security exploits on ISA/MCU architecture to bring "social attention" to the platform.
* Devised approach of working from individual application layers down to a platform/bootloader

### 10/21/2021
* Last logbook entry before due date!
* Looking into setting up our CI/CD and pipeline hygiene, will set a workshop for Gherkin Model user story writing to "nail down" our functionality and describe "pin-pointed" features
* Looking into LCD libraries for TIMSP, and how to not only write sample code, but also flash binaries into the rom
* looking into creating a Basic Input Output System to control the memory management of the applications and inpit (BIOS).
### 10/26/2021
* First logbook entry for Logbook #2
* Set up a CI/CD Pipeline, officially all unstable code will be pushed to our invididual branches. Once functionality is confirmed, code will be merged to testing for debugging on secondary boards and then relesed to stable once we are satisfied and decide to start another function.
* Essentially team member scratchpads --> testing --> main
* Our First IDR went well, only feedback from Prof Osama was to bewary when opening up the repo and to ensure that there isn't too much involvement from the client side.
* Discussed logistics of Trello/Agile and User Story Writing using the gherkin model. Wrote a sample story to discuss how tackling solutions using "the smallest vertical slice" allows for concision and accuracy when describing functionality from a user perspective.
* Began to play around with some test code from TI and using TI dev tools. Got an LED to blink (our helloworld) and was able to wrtie scrolling text using the segmented display built into the evalutation board.
* Set up a meeting with the client to touch base and discuss project status. 
### 10/28/2021
* User story session 1! Wrote our first Epic. Epic #1, Gilgamesh, has 4 user stories which focus on the inital functioning of the badge, AKA "main menu" functionality.
	* Story 1: First Boot/Power On Sequence
	* Story 2: Main Menu and Bootloader
	* Story 3: Main Menu Navigation
	* Story 4: Program Execution and Return
* Trello Board link will be made public eventually!
* Along the way we also made the following design decisions:
	* Attempt to source another LCD module which will allow us to draw custom graphics.
	* If that doesn't pan out, either use the current LCD on the evaluation/development board AND use the badge itself as a "serial" console to PC/make an application that uses the terminal output as it's GUI.
* We also decided on the following roles
	* Derek & Ryan -- Software
	* Julia * John -- Cybersecurity and Display Modules
	* Carlos -- Design/Architecture
## November 
Entries here will be specifically reserved for the month of November.

### 11/2/2021
* Start of Sprint 1: My+Ryan's role is to interact with the bootloader for the MSP420.
* GIT Logs here:
	* adding bootloader to src -- COMMIT 10EAB35
	* adding mspboot and apps to repo -- COMMIT 01fb27c
	* cleaned up stuff. Deleted old objects and cloned samples of bootloader -- COMMIT 3ac7051
	* attempting to figure out what is going on with gmake compile errors -- COMMIT f322794
## 11/3/2021
* Rewriting <include> files to get the demo bootloader applications to function on non-windows systems
	* the demos written by the TI team were targeted for windows, so a lot of the dependency paths are written with "C:\" Win32 style NTFS directories rather than the standard Unix-like method of accessing directories from root "/usr/bin"
* Gmake continues to fail on compile, potential broken Gmake modules
* Build failures attributed to "all" target failing. I am suspecting that the built-in makefile may be broken.
* Came to realization that the demo files were written with an older version of the MSP compiler in mind, newer versions of the compiler break the "all" build rule in the makefile.
* Downloaded and installed a new version of the compiler, .c files are able to be compiled with succesful output.
* However, getting the bootloader to load and switch between two applications (at least with the demo files) is a bit of a complicated process:
	* For some reason, the demo requires us to compile the C code, which results in a .txt file being generated.
	* This .txt file needs to be copied to a certain directory for both applications (App1 and App2)
	* Once copied, the .bat (windows batch file) for some reason takes the .txt file and uses a python script to convert it back to C (weird, right?)
	* The both C files are then compiled down to one object and passed onto the bootloader. A host board is then required to flash the target board with the desired programs.
	* All in all, overcomplication for something that was supposed to be a bit more straightforward. The tutorial seemed to provide an example of how to provide OTA updates rather than focus on creating a bootloader.
* Ryan and I are scrapping this approach and will simply write our own self-contained bootloader that will simply be an application that calls different appications in memory.
### 11/4/2021
* First attempt at creating our own bootloader was highly unsuccesful. We were not able to compile code that was effective in getting anything done.
* Documented some issues with the TI Documentation. Decided to stop and focus on helping other teammembers complete their tasks.
* Assisted Carlos in getting KiCad reinstalled after major vulnerability expoit in the binary was leaked.
* Assisted John and Julian in getting their serial console to "print something"
* Set up a clean instance of the IDE back to a "hello world" state.

### 11/8/2021
* Met with Ryan to arrange time on Tuesday to get a headstart before prototypes, want some sort of "app loader" functional by Thursday.
* Played around with the LCDs and read up on datasheets to better understand them.
