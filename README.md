# SENIOR DESIGN SESSION 1 LOGBOOK REPO

pulled directly from the slides:

* Logbooks are on-line (Blackboard Journal)
* Graded by logbook groups according to the course schedule
* There is a logbook entry in the “context menu” of the course Blackboard
* Should document your ~daily engineering design work – INDIVIDUAL contributions
* Graded twice this semester
* Substantial contributor (20%) to your course grade
* Entries time&date stamped
* Expect frequent entries (at least once per week)
* All entries made at end of grading period = ZERO


essentially, it is recommended to do logbook entries a few times a week, and to consistently upload them to blackboard.
For the sake of redundancy, I have uploaded a markdown file to this repo, and will be updating the file on blackboard with my attached git log for proof


this will also where a bunch of other docs go
